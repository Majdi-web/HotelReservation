# HotelReservation
A hotel reservation system is a software application that is implemented by hotels to allow guests to create secure online reservations. The hotel reservation system can be synced, not only with your current website, but also with Facebook. This allows guests to reserve rooms in a way that is convenient for them via social media.

In addition to allowing guests to book online directly, these reservation systems can also provide hotel operators with additional resources.

# To run the Reservation System:

* Open the Comandprompt.

* Change Current Working Directory to the directory the files are in.

* Compile the Java code using the command javac.

* Run the code using the command java Mainsys.

* Follow the onscreen prompts.

Notes: Mainsys.java is where the main method is held. Run this class file. Do NOT alter the csv files in anyway doing so will cause the program to malfunction.
